In a traditional approach to application architecture, the components—such as database logic, web application servers, user interfaces, and business logic—are tightly coupled. This means that if one component fails, it can cause the failure of other components, potentially bringing down the entire application.</p><p style="background-color:white;"><img style="padding-block:1rem;" src="'+d+'"></p><h4 id="microservices-architecture" tabindex="-1">Microservices architecture <a class="header-anchor" href="#microservices-architecture" aria-label="Permalink to “Microservices architecture”">​</a></h4><p>To improve application availability and resilience, you can adopt a microservices architecture. In this approach, application components are loosely coupled, meaning that if one component fails, the others continue to function normally. The communication between components remains intact, and the failure of a single component does not impact the entire system.
