You want to analyze all types of data to drive actionable insights, be prepared for the unexpected, create new revenue streams, improve customer experience, and increase operational efficiencies.</p><p>The data discovery process consists of a number of interactive sessions with various stakeholders within an organization. Sometimes this starts with an initial session to identify new ways to extract value from your data, while at other times, it could be with a specific use-case around what you want to do. You can go straight into identifying key people and diving deep to gather the information that is need in order to determine your best possible solution.</p><p>In either case, the end goal is to maximize the value you get from the data and identify appropriate next steps. This includes how you plan to consume data, what data sources you have and how to ingest that data, and then potentially what types of transformations you may need for the data.</p><p>The common issue that can hold you back from maximizing the value of your data is the variety of data silos within your organization. Silos can prevent you from extracting maximum value from all your data with the greatest flexibility. Data warehouses can help with this to a point, but often only a small portion of raw data is bought into the data warehouse. Organizations often end up with multiple data warehouses, so you can still have these silos. There are a number of modern approaches to enterprise-wide analytics that can help solve this – such as data lakes, modern data architectures, and data mesh. If you are not already exploring these modern approaches, this is a good opportunity to learn more about these architectures in the following sections.</p><p>Another common issue is whether you can benefit from increasing the velocity at which you ingest and process your data. Many organizations still have a predominantly batch-oriented strategy to processing the data, where a majority of your data is processed on a daily schedule. You can ask yourself questions such as ‘How can we benefit if we have access to more up-to-date data?” AWS can help you explore options for ingesting streaming data, and for processing data in micro-batches or employ stream processing.</p><p>If you have previously explored streaming options in the past, you might have been concerned about the complexity of some of these solutions, but there are many AWS-managed solutions for streaming that significantly reduces much of this complexity.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">What is Data Discovery</p><p>The process of finding and understanding relevant data sources within an organization and the relationships between them</p></div><p>In general, data discovery consists of five steps:</p><h3 id="_1-define-the-business-value" tabindex="-1">1.
