You learned when to use fully managed options like Lambda or Fargate, and when full control with Amazon EC2 made sense. You explored how containers solve deployment consistency issues and how AWS services, like Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, simplify managing and scaling containerized applications. You also discovered services like Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Batch, Lightsail, and Outposts, and how each supported specific use cases, from basic web hosting to large-scale batch processing or hybrid cloud environments.</p><h3 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#resources" aria-label="Permalink to “Resources”">​</a></h3><p>To learn more about the material covered in this module, choose the resource links contained in the following table.</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Resource Link</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/containers/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Containers on AWS</a></td><td>The AWS Containers Services page provides an overview of the AWS container offerings, including services for container image storage, orchestration, and compute.
