It&#39;s important to build your knowledge of cloud computing piece by piece. However, in reality, the concepts you learn about in this training work together, not separately. In this lesson, you explore your first example of the Cloud in Real Life, piecing together how abstract cloud concepts work together to drive innovation and efficiency for your business.</p><h3 id="cloud-in-real-life-infrastructure-and-shared-responsibility" tabindex="-1">Cloud in real life: Infrastructure and shared responsibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-in-real-life-infrastructure-and-shared-responsibility" aria-label="Permalink to “Cloud in real life: Infrastructure and shared responsibility”">​</a></h3><p>Previously we examined how AWS Global Infrastructure and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model work together for your business solution. For this use case, the global ecommerce company deployed resources to multiple AWS Regions and Availability Zones. To learn more about the benefits this infrastructure design achieves and how AWS and the company share responsibility, choose each of the following three numbered markers.</p><p><img style="padding-block:1rem;" src="'+t+'"></p><h3 id="ecommerce-company-expansion" tabindex="-1">Ecommerce company expansion <a class="header-anchor" href="#ecommerce-company-expansion" aria-label="Permalink to “Ecommerce company expansion”">​</a></h3><p>This ecommerce company is based in Seattle, Washington in the United States. The company wants to expand to global locations. However, the further the computing infrastructure is from their customers, the longer the latency. The company decides to expand to global AWS Regions to better reach their global customers.</p><h3 id="global-expansion-one-ireland" tabindex="-1">Global expansion one: Ireland <a class="header-anchor" href="#global-expansion-one-ireland" aria-label="Permalink to “Global expansion one: Ireland”">​</a></h3><p>The company deploys resources to the eu-west-1 Region in Ireland. Deploying in multiple Regions increases high availability. The company increases fault-tolerance and high availability even more by deploying to two Availability Zones in this Region.</p><p>The company does not need to worry about securing the data center in Ireland because securing the physical infrastructure is an AWS responsibility. The company can instead focus on securing and encrypting their data within their cloud resources.</p><h3 id="global-expansion-two-singapore" tabindex="-1">Global expansion two: Singapore <a class="header-anchor" href="#global-expansion-two-singapore" aria-label="Permalink to “Global expansion two: Singapore”">​</a></h3><p>The company has a significant customer base in Asia, too. So, they deploy resources to the ap-southwest-1 AWS Region in Singapore.</p><p>Rather than having to set up physical infrastructure at an international scale, which can take months or years, the company used AWS to deploy global operations within a matter of minutes.</p><h3 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to “Conclusion”">​</a></h3><p>In conclusion, AWS Web Services provided the ecommerce company with the flexibility, speed, and reliability needed to expand globally without the burden of building and maintaining physical infrastructure. By leveraging AWS Regions and Availability Zones, the company reduced latency for customers worldwide, improved fault tolerance, and ensured high availability. The AWS Shared Responsibility Model allowed the company to focus on securing its data and applications while AWS handled the security of the underlying infrastructure. What would have taken months or years with traditional data centers was achieved in minutes through AWS, enabling rapid innovation, faster customer reach, and cost efficiency. This use case highlights how AWS solves the problems of scalability, global accessibility, and operational complexity, making it an ideal choice for businesses aiming to expand and serve customers at a global scale.</p>',17)])])}const y=a(s,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
