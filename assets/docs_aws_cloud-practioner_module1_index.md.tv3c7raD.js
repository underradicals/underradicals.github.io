The CSM consists of a Client and a Server, where the Client can be a broswer, phone, a watch or any IoT device. The Server, unlike a Client which is always a producer of messages, the Server is always a consumer of messages. The client asks the server for a resource like a JSON payload, image, html page, or a combination of all of the above. Regardless of what is being sent over the wire it starts as a request to the server and culminates in a response to the client.</p><h3 id="cloud-computing" tabindex="-1">Cloud Computing <a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-computing" aria-label="Permalink to “Cloud Computing”">​</a></h3><p>AWS defines <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> as <code>The On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with paty-as-you-go pricing.</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Cloud Computing</p><p>The On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with paty-as-you-go pricing.</p></div><h3 id="cloud-deployment-types" tabindex="-1">Cloud deployment types <a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-deployment-types" aria-label="Permalink to “Cloud deployment types”">​</a></h3><p>You can deploy cloud resources in multiple ways: cloud, on-premises, and hybrid. Each type offers unique benefits and considerations, and exploring these options can help you make informed decisions about your cloud strategy. To learn more about cloud deployment types, choose each of the following flashcards.</p><h4 id="cloud" tabindex="-1">Cloud <a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud" aria-label="Permalink to “Cloud”">​</a></h4><p>In a cloud-based deployment model, you have the flexibility to migrate your existing resources to the cloud, design and build new applications within the cloud environment, or use a combination of both. For instance, a company might migrate data resources to the cloud, then develop an application comprised of virtual servers, databases, and networking components entirely hosted in the cloud.</p><h4 id="on-premise" tabindex="-1">On-Premise <a class="header-anchor" href="#on-premise" aria-label="Permalink to “On-Premise”">​</a></h4><p>Deploying resources on premises using virtualization and resource management tools does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing. However, it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources and low latency. In most cases this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try increasing resource utilization.</p><h4 id="hybrid" tabindex="-1">Hybrid <a class="header-anchor" href="#hybrid" aria-label="Permalink to “Hybrid”">​</a></h4><p>In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources and on-premises infrastructure work together. This approach is ideal for situations where legacy applications must remain on premises due to maintenance preferences or regulatory requirements. For instance, a company might choose to retain certain regulated legacy applications on-premises while using cloud services for advanced data processing and analytics. Multi-cloud deployments can also be considered hybrid deployments.</p>',15)])])}const m=a(i,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
