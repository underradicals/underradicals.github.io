A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to an Auto Scaling group. As the number of EC2 instances fluctuates in response to traffic demands, incoming requests are first directed to the load balancer. From there, the traffic is distributed evenly across the available instances.</p><p>Although ELB and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling are distinct services, they work in tandem to enhance application performance and ensure high availability. Together, they enable applications running on Amazon EC2 to scale effectively while maintaining consistent performance.</p><h3 id="elb-benefits" tabindex="-1">ELB benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#elb-benefits" aria-label="Permalink to “ELB benefits”">​</a></h3><p>Let&#39;s review the main benefits of elastic load balancing and how it enhances the performance, scalability, and management of your AWS environment.

In the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals and medical facilities that provide online appointment booking systems or patient portals, website traffic can vary greatly throughout the day.</p><h4 id="initial-setup-low-demand-period" tabindex="-1">Initial Setup: Low-demand period: <a class="header-anchor" href="#initial-setup-low-demand-period" aria-label="Permalink to “Initial Setup: Low-demand period:”">​</a></h4><p>At the beginning of the day, only a few patients are accessing the system to book appointments or view medical records. The existing web servers are sufficient to handle the low traffic. This matches the demand, with no need for additional resources at this point.</p><h4 id="scaling-up-high-demand-period" tabindex="-1">Scaling Up: High-demand period: <a class="header-anchor" href="#scaling-up-high-demand-period" aria-label="Permalink to “Scaling Up: High-demand period:”">​</a></h4><p>As the day progresses, especially during peak hours, such as early mornings or just before the weekend, more patients access the portal to book appointments, view test results, or contact medical professionals. To handle this surge in demand, the healthcare system automatically scales up the number of servers to help ensure that the system remains responsive and available for all users.</p><h4 id="load-balancing" tabindex="-1">Load Balancing: <a class="header-anchor" href="#load-balancing" aria-label="Permalink to “Load Balancing:”">​</a></h4><p>A load balancer directs the incoming traffic to different web servers based on their current load. For instance, if one server starts receiving too many requests, the load balancer will route new requests to a less busy server. This makes sure that no single server becomes overwhelmed. The traffic is evenly distributed across available EC2 instances.</p><p>By using Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling, the healthcare industry can efficiently manage the varying levels of patient traffic to online services. This provides reliable access to medical portals even during high-demand periods.</p>',23)])])}const b=e(l,[["render",c]]);export{u as __pageData,b as default};
