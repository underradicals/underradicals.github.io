Availability Zones (AZs) are configured as isolated resources, and they are each equipped with independent power, networking, and connectivity.</p><p>It&#39;s recommended to distribute your resources across multiple AZs. That way, if one AZ encounters an outage, your business applications will continue to operate without interruption. With this approach of redundancy and resource isolation, AWS customers can achieve the benefits of high availability and fault tolerance.</p><p><img style="padding-block:1rem;" src="'+r+'"></p>',13)])])}const g=e(l,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
