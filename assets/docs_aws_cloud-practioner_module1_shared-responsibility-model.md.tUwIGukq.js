Components such as server-side encryption, network traffic protection, platform and application management, and OS, network, and firewall configuration vary by service in terms of who is responsible for these items. As you learn more about different types of services, you will see specific examples of how these elements are divided between the customer and AWS.</p><ul><li>Server Side Encryption</li><li>Network Traffic Protection</li><li>Platform and Application Management</li><li>OS, network, firewall configuration</li></ul><h4 id="aws-responsibility" tabindex="-1">AWS Responsibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#aws-responsibility" aria-label="Permalink to “AWS Responsibility”">​</a></h4><p>AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud.
