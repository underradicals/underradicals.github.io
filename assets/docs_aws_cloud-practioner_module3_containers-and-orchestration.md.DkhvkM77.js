This helps to move, update, and manage. Containers are faster and lighter than virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host computer’s operating system. VMs use a hypervisor to run full, separate operating systems, which makes them less resource-efficient and have longer startup times.</p><h4 id="deployment-consistency-with-containers" tabindex="-1">Deployment consistency with containers <a class="header-anchor" href="#deployment-consistency-with-containers" aria-label="Permalink to “Deployment consistency with containers”">​</a></h4><p>When a developer’s environment differs from staging or production, deployments can fail and become difficult to debug.

A setup that began with a few containers on a single host can quickly grow into hundreds or thousands of containers across multiple hosts. At that scale, manually handling container lifecycle, monitoring, and general operations becomes unsustainable. This is where orchestration tools come in.
