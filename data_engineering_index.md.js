One of the most important assets of a business is the data it produces. I make a distinction between data and information here. Data is just raw facts and figures, a line on an invoice, a row in an excel sheet, a key value pair in a json file. Data comes in three flavors: Structured Data, like JSON files or CSV files, Semi-Structured Data, and Unstructured data like images and Data does not become information until it has been processed and the value of its data been extracted and formalized. Information is data that has provided a return on the investment that produced the data. In particular, data is the input and information is the output after processing.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="data-modeling" tabindex="-1">Data Modeling <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-modeling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data Modeling&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WHAT IS INFORMATION</p><h3 id="information-is-data-that-has-been-converted-into-a-meaningful-and-useful-context" tabindex="-1"><strong>Information is data that has been converted into a meaningful and useful context.</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#information-is-data-that-has-been-converted-into-a-meaningful-and-useful-context" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Information is data that has been converted into a meaningful and useful context.**&quot;">​</a></h3></div><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WHAT IS A FACT</p><h3 id="a-fact-is-the-confirmation-or-validation-of-an-event-or-object" tabindex="-1"><strong>A fact is the confirmation or validation of an event or object.</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-fact-is-the-confirmation-or-validation-of-an-event-or-object" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**A fact is the confirmation or validation of an event or object.**&quot;">​</a></h3></div>',5)]))}const m=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
